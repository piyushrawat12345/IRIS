**Project Name**

IRIS(Initiative for Research and Innovation in STEM)

**Overview**

This project uses machine learning to identify the type of iris flower—Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica—based on the size of its petals and sepals. The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset often used to learn how classification works in machine learning.

We clean and explore the data, make some charts to understand it better, and then use different machine learning models to see which one can best predict the flower type. This project is a great way to understand how machine learning works with simple, structured data.

**Features**

Data exploration and visualization (pair plots, histograms, correlation heatmaps)

Feature scaling (if necessary)

Training using machine learning classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forest)

Performance evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix

Comparison of classifier performance
